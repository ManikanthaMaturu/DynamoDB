Clone the project repository by running the following command:

sh
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git


Replace `username` with the actual username and `project` with the project name.

Move into the cloned project directory:

cd project


## Installing Dependencies

sh
python -m venv venv


Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

sh
venv\Scripts\activate


On macOS and Linux:

sh
source venv/bin/activate


Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Configuration

Copy the configuration template file if provided:

sh
cp config_template.ini config.ini


Modify the `config.ini` file with your configuration settings.

## Running the Project

You're all set up! Now you can run the project using the provided scripts or commands. Refer to the project documentation for specific instructions on how to run and use the project.

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

Once you're done using the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

sh
deactivate
